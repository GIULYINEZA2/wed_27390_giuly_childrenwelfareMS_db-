## Project Overview

The **Children Welfare Management System (CWMS)** is a PL/SQL-based Oracle system for managing children under 18 in orphanages. It centralizes child records, monitors educational progress, and tracks support services, especially for children with disabilities. The system replaces manual record-keeping with automated, accurate, and secure data management.
